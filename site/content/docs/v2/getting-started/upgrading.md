## Get Started

There is a command-line script designed to help you upgrade your Modus Bootstrap 1 (Bootstrap 4) projects to Modus Bootstrap 2 (Bootstrap 5). It uses gulp with gulp-replace to replace class names within your folder of HTML pages/templates and it can save a lot of time.

## Print Styles

Modus Bootstrap doesn't include Print styles, though you can use the bootstrap-print-css from npm.
